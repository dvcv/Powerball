# Powerball
I created this repository to show people why playing Powerball is not a smart investment. I did this by creating a simple simulation in R. 

Here you will find three folders. Eash one contains a pdf and Rmd files.

Powerball1: Why millionaires do not play powerball    
  -Powerball1.pdf  
  -Powerball1.Rmd  
Powerball2: Why you should not gamble on powerball   
  -Powerball2.pdf  
  -Powerball2.Rmd  
Powerball3: Why powerball ticket (1,2,3,4,5,+6) has the same odds as a quickpick    
  -Powerball3.pdf  
  -Powerball3.Rmd  
  
Pdf files contain my output from the Rmd files. If you would like to run your own simulation using my code look at open the Rmd files in each folder. Make sure you also have R Studio intstalled on your computer.
